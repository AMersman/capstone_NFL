 ## Abstract
Sports gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry. It is im-
perative that the industry can predict the outcome of sporting events,
including the winner as well as the scoring differences or points scored per
player. This project seeks to predict the game outcome of NFL games,
including winner and score difference, based on previous game outcomes,
including stadium and weather conditions of the game. There are three
datasets with team information, game information, and stadium infor-
mation. The data will be cleaned, exploratory data analysis will be per-
formed to inspect the variables and their relationships. The data will
then be preprocessed for both classification and regression models. The
models was analyzed against each other and a dummy model to deter-
mine if any model is viable for predicting outcome and which model
performed best. None of the models outperformed the dummy model
in any statistically significant way, we were equally as likely to get the
write answer using the mean score difference or the most likely winner
than using any of the other models. Team performance is an aggregate of
player performance so it is recomennded to include player performance
and team make up for the games to account for the fluidity of the team
through the season and year

## Introduction
In 2023, approximately 28% of the American public was expected to bet on the
NFL. That’s 73 million people for an increase of almost 60% from the previous
year. Sports betting is legal in 34 states and counting and is a multi-billion dollar
industry. [1]
Being able to predict game outcomes and optimize the spread is highly prof-
itable for the industry. The spreads must be close enough to incentivize bettors
but also large enough to maximize profits and cover any losses.
Game information (date, season, week, teams, and scores), betting infor-
mation (favorite to win, spread, over/under), stadium information (stadium,
location, elevation, field type, and stadium type) and weather information (tem-
perature, wind speed, and humidity).
